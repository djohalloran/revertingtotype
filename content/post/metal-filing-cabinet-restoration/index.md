What is stainless steel?


What is rust?
Any metal made of iron or alloys containing iron, such as steel, will rust with enough exposure to oxygen and moisture.
first remove as much loose rust as possible from the surface first. Otherwise, the metal will continue to shed the loose rust, pushing the dried paint coat upward until it blisters or peels off.
You’ll need to apply a primer to boost paint adhesion and prevent discoloration. 

What's flash rust?
flash rust from humidity. 

What's a primer?
HERE ARE MANY PRIMERS AVAILABLE FOR THE MARKET. EACH SERVE A DISTINCT PURPOSE. OFF THE SHELF PRIMER IS MEANT STRICKLY FOR ADHESION FOR THE FINISH COAT. SOME PRIMERS ARE FILLER PRIMERS MEANT TO COVER SCRATCHES IN THE METAL. THEN THERE ARE PRIMER SURFACERS AND PRIMER SEALERS. FOR A PRIMER TO PREVENT RUST IT MUST SAY ON THE PRODUCT "WITH RUST INHIBITOR". HOPE THAT HELPS

A rust-inhibitive primer can curb potential rust development to keep your metal looking and functioning its best for years to come. 

Most primers you buy in a rattle can, such as Rustoleum, duplicolor, Case-IH, are nothing more than enamel finish coat, with flattening agent in it. The flattening agent takes the shine from the paint, but it is the same as the regular enamel paints they sell. This is true of Laquers too. Laquer primer is nothing more than rapidly drying laquer paint without gloss additive.

I have read plenty of misconceptions on the internet about this stuff, even on well known DYI autobody forums.

Now, for the more advanced primers you'd buy in automotive grade applications...

in order:

etching primer - used primarily as a tie coat to link bare (unsanded) steel to topcoat or build primer. This doesn't provide much of a rust inhibitor, but will prevent flash rust from humidity.

vinyl wash primer - primer developed for military and marine applications to seal out moisture from steel. This type of primer is extremely durable and water proof. The drawbacks are it's poor adhesion to unsanded steel, and it's lack of compatibility when used with an underlying tie coat.

epoxy primer - The most commonly used primer over bare steel. This primer provides very good protection from rust and is very durable. The drawbacks are, it no longer contains lead, so you must use an etching primer tie coat over unsanded bare steel, and it is very hard to sand and doesn't "build" very well.

2K Urethane build primer - This type of primer contains large amounts of solids to lay down thick coats, and is easy to sand. It is not intended to be placed directly on bare steel, and not only is it not a good protector from rust, but it also absorbs water, due to its high solids content. The most common solid in these types of primers is talc. This type of primer should be used overtop of an epoxy primer, or a vinyl wash primer, and then, before applying finish coat to this primer, you should use a sealer.

DTM primers - (Direct-To-Metal) primers are relatively new. They are corrosion resistant urethane primers that can be applied directly to bare sanded steel, and are high build, and do not require a sealer coat. They are a fast curing urethane and are ready to sand within 1 hour. These types of primers do not protect as well as others against corrosion but will allow for collision work to be done rapidly, and cost effective. The other drawback to this type of primer is the cost. I just bought a gallon of PPG NCP-271 and the hardener, and it was around $180 for the package. $180 for 1.33 gallons of sprayable material. That is a little more than $1 per ounce.

epoxy primer/sealer - this type of primer is used after build primer immediately before topcoating to seal moisture from the build primer. most topcoats are not very corrosion resistant because they are porous and allow oxygen to the metal. This extra step insures that moisture will not delaminate body fillers, or create lifting of the build primer, or surface oxidation. Most of these primers are the same as regular epoxy primers, except the TDS will have a different mixing ratio for sealer coat, so that the primer will be thinner and easier to lay down.

1500 grit wet sanding. The wet part of wet sanding refers to the use of water or some other liquid as lubrication to help carry away grit particles that are removed. Without the liquid, material can build up in the sandpaper and leave behind scratches that are larger than the particle size, ruining your finish. One big difference between dry sanding and wet sanding is the movement used. Dry sanding requires small circles; wet sanding uses straight lines, alternating direction between passes. This way, each successive pass works to remove the scratches from the previous one. Be sure to use a light touch as well — we’re not trying to remove a lot of material, just the scratches!

The orbital sander works better because the random lines help hide the scratches. 
Clearcoat protects paint from UV rays and the elements.


MAIN STEPS:
1.  Use 80 grit to remove worst rust
2. Use 180 grit to smooth the rest
3. Clean and degrease with white spirits
4. Primer, leave dry
5. Two coats of paint


Main Steps:

- Disassemble
- Sand 
- Clean 
- Add primer
- Add paint

- remove surface rust on nicely finished surfaces

- 80 grit sandpaper
- 180 grit sandpaper
- scouring pad - leaves some scratches but that's ok if it's going to be primed
- Sander

TIPS
----
Do sanding and paint tests on the back end of the cabinet where it won't be seen. This allows you to lock in your system.
Start at the back, make all your mistakes there
Need to wear breathing protection. Huge amount of dust and it doesn't feel like it. It get sup your nose.

SANDING
-------

Strike a balance between time and agressiveness.

A wheel grinder will be very aggressive and damage the metal more creating deep scratches.
80 grit sandpaper is going to be time consuming but gentler. Pads wear out quick though.

Dust collector is important.



Steel exposed to damp air begins to rust in minutes. If there is any rust on it when it is painted, the rust will spread under the paint

rust-resistant primer paints.

Define rust
Define idea of sanding metal

Priming is necessary because it gives the coating something to grab onto. “Primer serves as the foundation for the chosen coating system, as well as the corrosion protection for the asset,”
“Primers have the ability, because of their filling capabilities, to hide or fill in some defects of the metal. Industrial primers typically consist of either epoxy- or urethane-based primers depending on the overall requirements of the finished painted unit,

Not a whole lot of bad rust, relatively shallow so sandpaper is enough
No loost paint and rust to scrape away
For heavier metal then a wire brush would be better

Sanding can be tedious but set the time aside and get a good podcast or music

CLEANING
--------

This is vital
Might not seem, but your sandy metal is filthy and greasy and this will determine how well the primer adheres to the metal so get it right.
Degrease and clean using white spirits and allow to dry. Wear disposable gloves when doing this.
White spirits dissolves fats very well. This makes it an effective remedy for grease stains from leftover food, fingerprints, streaks of hands and feet and all other types of organic residue.
Methylated Spirit vs. White Spirit
Water and spirit should be mixed at a ratio of 10:1, that means 10 parts of water and 1 part of spirit. If the stains or residues are stronger, then a higher dosage is recommended. The cleaning agent thus obtained is just as durable as the glass cleaner from the trade and should be protected from direct light.

PRIMER
------


Rust starts quickly so don't wait too long between sanding and primer.

Daylight, you just won't see the contrast and spots you've missed otherwise
Ventilated area
Dust-free area
Rehearse how you're going to move the objecy - primer takes only a few minutes to dry

Steps

1. Ensure area is clean. Clean with white spirits
2. start on some cardboard to get a feel for the spray nozzle
2. Shake primer for one minute
3. Spray in short bursts. Multiple light coats is better than one long burst which will cause runs. Keep shaking regularly.
- sway over, keep moving
- overlap and build up
	overlap by 50%
	not runny, so get your distance right
- distance and speed

4. If you miss a spot go wait for it to dry and go back later
5. If you create drips or runs then wait until it dries, use some light sanding and re-spray

This package give us speeds of 150Mbps down and 30Mbps up, tripling our previous 4G download speeds and quadrupling the upload speed. Distance is not a factor when it comes to fibre, and while the maximum capacity is theoretically 1GB, the package speeds are fixed at speeds of 150Mbps down and 30Mbps up. In future we can upgrade the package to speeds of 300Mbps/50Mbps and 1000Mbps/100Mbps. 

The signal comes from the splice closure on the pole outside our house that's connected to an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) located on an internal wall. 

{{< figure caption="The cable linking the splice closure on the pole to the house and into an Optical Network Terminal (ONT)." src="/img/ftth-02.jpg" >}}

The ONT translates the light signals from the fibre optic line into electronic signals and passes them to the WAN port on the router via a standard ethernet cable.

However, the Sagemcom Eir fibre Box 1A 1.0 router supplied by Eir has a poor user interface and I wanted to try using an existing modem I had that I'd be more familiar with and would have a better interface. 

So I reached for a TP-Link TL-MR3420 v2 router but it didn't support VLAN tags which is necessary in order to work. A little bit of research informed me that installing OpenWRT on the MR3420 would provide VLAN support.

And the whole 7000 grit-mirror-finish thing is most definitely an issue on scale models, as you can imagine.  The things I figured out that kept me happy were a) hand-finish satin on wood is lovely, sand between coats, thin 10% to minimise brush strokes.  Or use a foam roller for the 'stippled' look.  B) spray the metals, mask things with strips and/or liquid masking gum, or preferably remove them if you can', the lightest of sanding between coats just for a key, many coats is better, an airbrush with compressor is best if you can get one, satin finish also cos it makes for nicer diffusion effects than gloss
