Things like measurements, room temperature and kneading time can all impact on the success of a loaf. Using a bread machine goes along way to ensuring at least the temperature and kneading are largely consistent and take the guesswork out of these aspects. That leaves you with just needing to be precise with your ingredients to guarantee dependable results.\nThe following proportions work well in a standard bread machine to produce a very light and flavoursome bread. The fennel and tomoto is a classic combination. The bread smells and tastes great when it comes out and also works well as toast the following day.\nThe recipe is designed for the standard 1KG loaf setting which takes 3 hours in most bread machines. On starting, the machine will create the initial dough mix and knead for about 10 minutes before an initial proving of about 30 mins. It will then knead the dough a second time for another 10 minutes and leave that to prove again at which point the baking will begin.\nAnother option is to use the bread machine\u0026rsquo;s dough setting to prove the bread and then transport it out of the machine and into a tin for baking in an oven - something you might want to do if you want more control on the browning of the bread.\n480g strong flour 350ml water 2 teaspoons dried yeast (or 1 x 7g sachet) 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon tomato puree 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, crushed in a pestle and mortar to release their aroma Measure out the water, puree and olive oil and combine into the bread machine bowl.\nWhile most bread recipes stipulate warm water to help speed up the yeast reaction, I\u0026rsquo;ve not found this necessary with a bread machine. Cold or room temperature water left overnight in the breadmaker produces the same results.\nSift the flour before adding it on top of the liquid ingredients.\nThe flour acts as a barrier between the wet ingredients and dry ingredients. This lets you delay the beginning of the mixing if you want to time it overnight to have the bread ready when you wake up. For example, setting the timer on the bread machine to begin at 4:30AM will produce a fresh and cooled loaf ready for eating at 8AM.\nSifting the flour aerates it and removes compaction which depending on how your flour was stored can have an impact on how the bread turns out.\nAdd the salt, sugar and fennel seeds on top of the flour.\nMake a small well on top of the flour and add the yeast, making sure it remains dry.\nStart the bread machine\u0026rsquo;s white loaf program or set it to start overnight so you can have the bread ready for the morning.\nWhen finished, take out the bread and let it cool on a rack before cutting.\n","date":"1 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/tomato-fennel-bread/","section":"Posts","summary":"Consistent results when making bread is tricky.

It allows you to host your product documentation in a version control system like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket and from that build a pretty website to display the content using an easily configurable \u0026ldquo;playbook\u0026rdquo; that controls the presentation and content versioning.\nInstalling Antora on a desktop machine requires a number of pre-requistive tools and libraries like Node Version Manager (NVM) and Node itself. In my experience, trying to get Antora installed on both Windows and Linux was plagued with problems relating to tool and library versioning issues.\nAn easier way is to run Antora in a Docker container so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about installing the various tools required and wrestle with OS and hardware incompatibilities. All you need to do is install Docker and tell it to run the official Antora container designed especially for Docker.\nYou can think of a Docker container image as a box with everything you need to run an application: the code, the runtime, the settings, and even the operating system itself. Docker containers isolate software from your machine\u0026rsquo;s environment so you can get up and running more quickly. So rather than installing and running Antora on your own computer, you install Docker and run Antora on its container image.\nIn this example we\u0026rsquo;re going to go a step further and instead of running Docker on a local machine, we\u0026rsquo;re going to run it within a DigitalOcean virtual environment hosted in the cloud.\nSTEP-BY-STEP\r#\rCreate a new Droplet in your DigitalOcean account. In my case I opted for one consisting of Docker 19.03.12 running on Ubuntu 20.04 with a regular shared CPU running 1GB RAM and basic block storage. I also just used password authentication.\nConnect to the Droplet using a Terminal tool. In my case I used PuTTy for Windows: Update Ubuntu in the Droplet: sudo apt -y upgrade\rCreate a directory for the Antora project: mkdir antora\rNavigate to the new antora directory and clone the Antora demo site. This will create a docs-site directory containing the Antora demo site and playbook file: git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/docs-site.git root@docker-ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-lon1-01:~/antora/docs-site# ls -la total 52 drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun 3 10:21 . drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jun 2 19:25 .. drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 Jun 2 19:39 .git -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35 Jun 2 19:25 .gitignore -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 291 Jun 2 19:25 .gitlab-ci.yml -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 16725 Jun 2 19:25 LICENSE -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1901 Jun 2 19:25 README.adoc -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 775 Jun 3 10:21 antora-playbook.yml drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jun 2 19:49 build\rThe antora-playbook.yml file contains all the details relating to the documentation site such as the various Markdown pages and the UI bundle that controls the HTML rendering of the site.\nThe official Antora Docker image for running Antora inside a container is published in the antora/antora project on Docker Hub. To use this, run the following docker run command to invoke the Antora Docker image with the playbook file: docker run -u $(id -u) -v $PWD:/antora:Z --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml\rThis command creates a new container using the Antora Docker image, mounts the current directory as the path /antora inside the container, runs the antora command on the Antora playbook, then stops and removes the container. It’s just like running a locally installed Antora command.\nBecause we\u0026rsquo;re running this in Linux we need to add the :Z or :z modifier to the volume mount, and the -u $(id -u) option to instruct Docker to run the entrypoint command as the current user. Otherwise, files will be written as root and become hard to delete. The -t flag allocates a pseudo-TTY required to display see the progress bars for Git operations.\nThe generated documentation site files will appear in the build/site directory.\nTo view the site properly in a web browser you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install a web server to host the site. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to open up the Droplet\u0026rsquo;s firewall so you can actually access it. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this in the following steps.\nThe simplest web server is the one that comes installed with Python 3 and the easiest way to install Python 3 in a droplet is to installed X-Tools which you can do using the following commandL: apt install golang-golang-x-tools\rBy default, all ports except 22 (SSH), 2375 (Docker) and 2376 (Docker) are blocked by a Droplet\u0026rsquo;s UFW firewall. So to allow HTTP requests to pass in and out, we need to open up a port like 8088 for example. Do this using the following command: ufw allow 8088\rNow launch the Python HTTP Server within the build/site directory using the following command: python3 -m http.server 8088\rNavigate to the droplet\u0026rsquo;s IP address on port 8088 to see the Antora test site: ","date":"3 June 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/antora-in-docker-on-digitalocean/","section":"Posts","summary":"OVERVIEW\r#\rAntora is an open source documentation site generator.

It was fiddly to configure and I wanted to see if I could swap it out for an existing and more familiar broadband router I already had. This article outlines how I did this by flashing the old router with open source OpenWRT/LEDE software and configuring a VLAN to get it to work.\nThe main reasons for doing this:\nA more familiar user interface Easier to configure things like firewalls, proxies etc. An excuse to write up a description of my current broadband setup BACKGROUND AND FIBRE ROLLOUT\r#\rI began my remote working life from Co. Kerry back in November 2003 and vividly remember the evening I got my first DSL connection up and running and was able to connect to a work desktop computer 200 miles away in my Dublin-based office and use it like I was physically sitting in front of it. The 4Mbps download speeds at that time seemed futuristic.\nIn the intervening years we moved to rural Co. Tipperary and continued using DSL, but due to living on the absolute edge of the 5km limit for DSL exchanges we got the absolute minimum available speeds at the time (about 0.8Mbps). Then around 2015 we ditched the DSL thanks to the availability of a strong 4G signal in the area and a relatively big jump to speeds of around 40Mbps.\nIn the meantime, next generation fibre optic broadband had started to make inroads with faster and longer range links. But countryside fibre seemed a distant dream until in mid 2019, Eir, Ireland\u0026rsquo;s largest telecoms provider, announced a €250m fibre investment to upgrade their national broadband infrastructure. The rollout began by focusing initially on bringing fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) with speeds up to 1Gps speeds to the outskirts of towns first, where traditional DSL speeds fall off and the benefits would be felt the most. Once the rural upgrade was completed, they would then move on to upgrading the towns and cities with newer FTTH equipment that supported even faster 10Gbps speeds.\nWe got lucky and made it as one of the 330,000 rural installations to benefit from Eir\u0026rsquo;s upgrade. Overnight a fibre optic cable and distribution box appeared on a pole opposite our house - the last on our stretch of road - giving us the very real possibility of up to 1 gigabit speeds.\nExample of a fibre optic splice closure seen on thousands of telephone poles all over Ireland. They house optical splitters that enable individual fibre cables to connect to a premises.\rWHAT EXACTLY DO WE MEAN BY FIBRE?\r#\rAt this point it\u0026rsquo;s worth clarifying a few things when it comes to broadband speeds that have been muddled due to overmarketing and general ambiguity. When Eir originally rolled out Fibre-to-the-Cabinet (FTTC) in 2010 they marketed it as \u0026ldquo;fibre broadband\u0026rdquo; even though it was still DSL that was bringing the internet into each home. So while the core \u0026ldquo;back bone\u0026rdquo; connection to the local cabinet had speeds of 1GB, the connection between the cabinet and the home was still just copper-based DSL and this could never be more than 100Mbps. Cable broadband helped somewhat with higher speeds of up to 500Mbps but unlike copper phone lines, not all parts of a town had cable.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth mentioning the National Broadband Plan (NBP) which was set up in 2019 to extend high-speed broadband to premises in hard-to-reach areas not served by Eir\u0026rsquo;s fibre upgrade. This promised speeds of 150Mbps by year one and 500Mbps by 2030 (EDIT the first official installation occured in January 2021).\nEIR PACKAGE AND SETUP\r#\rThe Eir package I opted for cost €45.99 per month (24 months) and I also paid a €49.99 installation fee which involved an engineer bringing a wire across the road, onto my gable end and in through the wall. The router was free and is a Sagemcom Eir fibre box 1A 1.0 CS 50001 which Eir brand as the F3000 or F5366s but only on the manual it seems (earlier FTTH customers seemed to get an F2000 which was a rebranded Huawei HG659b).\nSagemcom Eir fibre Box 1A 1.0 router branded by Eir as the F3000\rThis package give us speeds of up to 150Mbps down and 30Mbps up, tripling our previous 4G download speeds and quadrupling the upload speed. Distance is not a factor when it comes to fibre, and while the maximum capacity is theoretically 1GB, the package speeds are fixed at speeds of 150Mbps down and 30Mbps up. In future we can upgrade the package to speeds of 300Mbps/50Mbps and 1000Mbps/100Mbps.\nAverage speed test for the 150Mbps package.\rThe signal comes from the splice closure on the pole outside our house that\u0026rsquo;s connected to an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) located on an internal wall.\nThe cable linking the splice closure on the pole to the house and into an Optical Network Terminal (ONT).\rThe ONT translates the light signals from the fibre optic line into electronic signals and passes them to the WAN port on the router via a standard ethernet cable.\nThe Optical Network Terminal (ONT).\rHowever, the Sagemcom Eir fibre Box 1A 1.0 router supplied by Eir has a poor user interface and I wanted to try using an existing modem I had that I\u0026rsquo;d be more familiar with and would have a better interface.\nSo I reached for a TP-Link TL-MR3420 v2 router but it didn\u0026rsquo;t support VLAN tags which is necessary in order to work. A little bit of research informed me that installing OpenWRT on the MR3420 would provide VLAN support.\nTP-Link TL-MR3420 v2 router\rINSTALLING OPENWRT ON A GENREIC ROUTER \u0026amp; CONFIGURING THE VLAN\r#\rConfiguring a router to work with Eir\u0026rsquo;s fibre broadband connection requires setting its WAN port to recieve and transmit on a VLAN. Not all default firmwares allow this, but all the major opensource ones do, such as OpenWRT. I was able to install OpenWRT on the TP-Link TL-MR3420 v2 router after finding the OpenWRT site had firmware for this model.\nHere are the basic steps:\nDownload the firmware file and flash it onto a TP Link router using the firmware update option in the interface.\nPlug the ethernet cable into the router\u0026rsquo;s LAN port (not WAN) and connect another port to a laptop.\nNavigate to the OpenWRT interface using 192.168.1.1\nSet the password and enable wifi at this point in order to be able to connect to the router from your laptop using SSH over wifi.\nGo to Network \u0026gt; Switch and add a new VLAN and call it 10\nTo fully get the configuration working you\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit the /etc/config/network file as making the change the UI only seems to update the vid option, not the vlan option. So manually change the vlan option to 10 so it matches the vid.\nconfig switch_vlan option device \u0026#39;switch0\u0026#39; option vlan \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; option vid \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; config switch_vlan option device \u0026#39;switch0\u0026#39; option vlan \u0026#39;10\u0026#39; option vid \u0026#39;10\u0026#39; option ports \u0026#39;0t 2t\u0026#39;\rIf you need to change the router\u0026rsquo;s IP address then edit ipaddr: config interface \u0026#39;lan\u0026#39; option ifname \u0026#39;eth1\u0026#39; option force_link \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; option type \u0026#39;bridge\u0026#39; option proto \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; option ipaddr \u0026#39;192.168.1.254\u0026#39; option netmask \u0026#39;255.255.255.0\u0026#39; option ip6assign \u0026#39;60\u0026#39;\rRestart the router. CONCLUSION\r#\rWhile it\u0026rsquo;s useful to have an alternative router in the MR4320, its older \u0026ldquo;fast ethernet\u0026rdquo; 10/100 ports mean the maximum speeds that will come out of it will be under 100Mbps. This means that if I want the maximum speeds of 150Mbps my current fibre package has to offer, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to just stick to using the Sagemcom router with its Gigabit ports and ponder the pointlessness of this whole exercise.\nAnother option is buy a more modern router with Gigabit ports and either configure it with a VLAN as described above or setup the Sagemcom router in bridge mode and connect a better router downwind of it.\nUSEFUL LINKS\r#\rPost on the different speed packages offered by Eir\n","date":"25 April 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fibre-to-the-home/","section":"Posts","summary":"I recently signed up for Eir’s fibre-based broadband package and took an immediate dislike to the Sagemcom router that it came with.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much of it at the time as the camera still worked perfectly. The only minor annoyance was that the battery power indicator no longer appeared on the top LCD window or in the battery details screen in the main options panel. The problem became far greater when a week later I grabbed my camera to head to a local event only to realise that the previously fully charged battery was now empty despite little usage.\nAfter some quick searching online I found that this problem is quite common with the Canon 7D: it\u0026rsquo;s due to a motherboard screw becoming lose and eventually coming to rest somewhere that causes a short that not only blocks the camera from communicating with the battery but also causes the battery to discharge even when the camera is powered off.\nBoth the videos I watched online showed the offending screw as being located on the underside circuit board next to the camera chamber. However, when I opened up my camera the same screw was intact. Taking off the entire back panel of the camera so I could get a better look at the main motherboard showed no missing screws either. Neither was there any rattle or sound of any loose screws when I shook the camera.\nDejected, I began to doubt the \u0026ldquo;loose screw\u0026rdquo; theory. But further reading only offered alternative options that involved putting the camera in a freezer for \u0026ldquo;6 or 7\u0026rdquo; minutes as some people maintained the problem was due to temperature related expansion and contraction of battery connector components. This didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a very scientific approach so I decided I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to go down that route, at least just yet.\nAbout the give up and resort to flying blind with my battery indicator plus the added awkwardness of having to take the battery out each time I finished with the camera to stop it discharging; I decided to have one last look around the inside of the camera. Thankfully, I spotted a screw that had lodged itself next to the motor\u0026rsquo;s magnet. Where this screw came from, I have no idea - all the obvious screw holes were intact. This must have come from somewhere out of sight, perhaps from behind the main motherboard. I plucked the offending screw out and did a quick battery test: everything was back to normal. The camera was once again communicating with the battery.\nI decided to leave the screw out entirely instead of dismantling the camera any further to locate its rightful place. Perhaps this is a risky tactic and could make an inner component prone to movement or vibration. I\u0026rsquo;ll just monitor the camera for the next few weeks and months and see how it performs. If additional problems start to crop up at least I\u0026rsquo;ll know the likely issue.

But at over 4km from the exchange the average speeds of around 1.5Mbps download and 0.4Mbps upload have become primitive in comparison to what\u0026rsquo;s available from the newer fibre and mobile broadband services starting to roll out across the country. Things took a turn for the worse a few weeks ago when, despite repeated calls to Eircom support, the best stable speeds I could get dropped to about 0.54Mbps. I even took a screenshot. Something to show the grandchildren in years to come:\nEircom ADSL Speeds\rThe main contender as an alternative to Eircom fixed line is Vodafone Mobile Broadband. We\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky to have a really good Vodafone 3G signal in the area where I live (the village of Dualla) the past few years. Fortune shone again about 6 months ago when a 4G signal became available - despite it still being unattainable in more built-up areas close to us, like Thurles, for example.\nOther providers such as 3 and O2 offer plans with more data but their signal is non-existent in our area. And while there are other wireless alternatives available in the area, such as Premier Broadband for instance, their packages are currently not much ahead of Eircom in terms of bandwidth (around 2MB up/down) and there\u0026rsquo;s also no guarantee their service will work due to line-of-sight issues.\nSo I decided to experiment with two possible solutions: Vodafone and Meteor. Both plans have cooling off periods meaning I could try them both for 7 days (14 days in the case of Vodafone) with the option of a \u0026ldquo;no quibble\u0026rdquo; return and refund if they proved unsuitable.\nVodafone\r#\rVodafone have easily the best quality signal and the Huawei R215 device that came with the package detected a 4G connection almost anywhere in the house.\nHuawei R215\rThe best location however was the attic where I could get speeds of around 18Mbps and ping times of 30 - 45ms.\nVodafone 4G Speeds\rSo what\u0026rsquo;s the problem? The main impediment so far with moving to a 3G or 4G service has been the lack of a plan with unlimited data. Because I do a lot of work from home I could easily go through 40-60GB of data a month. But the best Vodafone can offer at the moment is a plan with a data usage limit of 20GB. This is paltry; especially in terms of 4G bandwidth. Another annoying factor is that Vodafone require a minimum 12 month contract at about €30 per month \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be tied into something for this long.\nThe real deal breaker however is that I want to hook the modem into a TP-LINK MR3220 3G/4G router I have so I can distribute the signal around the house. Try as I might I could not get it to detect the R215 device no matter what settings I used.\nSo, while a great performer in terms of speed, the Vodafone solution had just too many niggly issues to make it a runner.\nMeteor\r#\rThe Meteor router came in the form of a Huawei E5377. The package is branded as XXL and costs 24 euro per month including VAT and the data usage limit is 30GB.\nHuawei E5377\rWhen I initially turned it in I could only get a 2G signal. I had feared this as my understanding was that Meteor shared the O2 network which has a very poor reception around here. To my surprise, however, when I took the router into the attic I was able to get a strong 3G signal. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sample speedtest:\nMeteor 3G Speeds\rSo while Meteor\u0026rsquo;s 3G speeds were around half the speed and double the ping times of the Vodafone router\u0026rsquo;s 4G signal, it was still more than adequate for my requirements. And at 6 euro cheaper per month and only a 6 month contract it was starting to look like a runner. The best was yet to come. The TP-LINK 4G router detected it within moments of plugging the E5377 into its USB port.\nThe only concern was that even at 30GB a month, it may not be enough before incurring excess charges. So I tried it for a few days and found that I was averaging around 1GB a day. This included a few Webex sessions with work and almost constant VPN connectivity to the office. So with some care it would certainly be possible to keep things within the 30GB limit if I avoided streaming video and the like. And if I did need more data Meteor offer an add-on of 20GB for 20 euro which would bring my limit up to 50GB; all for €44 a month.\nSo I returned the Vodafone router and opted for the Meteor package.\nThe Setup\r#\rAs mentioned already, the wifi signal on a small mobile broadband router like the Huawei E5377 or R215 is never going to be strong enough to broadcast around the entire house. You can get around this by using a dedicated 4G router that will greatly extend your wifi capacity and provide ethernet ports for additional devices such as file servers, printers etc.\nI already had a TP-LINK MR3220 3G/4G router I picked up some time ago and until now was lying unused.\nTP-LINK MR3220 3G/4G\rThis router has a USB port on its side that will take the connection from the Huawei E5377 and automatically relay its internet connection.\nBecause these devices must reside in the attic in order to catch the best reception, I also need a way of bringing the signal downstairs to another router under my stairs where my file server resides and where I broadcast another wifi signal. To do this I got a set of TP-LINK 300Mbps AV200 Powerline Extenders.\nTP-LINK 300Mbps AV200 Powerline Extenders\rOne plugs into an attic socket. It takes an ethernet cable from the MR3220 and sends the data down to the second plug downstairs. This second home plug broadcasts the data it gets from the attic over its own wifi. It also has two ethernet ports, one of which connects to a NAS server.\nBelow is a schematic of how it all hangs together. A bit convoluted, no doubt, but it works well. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping there\u0026rsquo;s a way I use WPS to perhaps cut out the TP-LINK router from the chain but I\u0026rsquo;ve had no joy so far trying to get the powerline adapter play nice with the Huawei E5377.\nThe Full Setup\rUpdate #1\r#\rThe setup has been in place a few months now and is generally working well and the 3G/4G speeds are a much needed improvement over the miniscule 1MB speeds were were living with. There\u0026rsquo;s been no huge downsides apart from the odd day or two where the 3G signal in the area went AWOL. I\u0026rsquo;m also finding it virtually impossible to stay within the data 30GB limit. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot closer to 50MB and sometimes even more. I\u0026rsquo;ve therefore had to purchase a monthly 20GB add-on giving me 50GB a month by default. Some months I\u0026rsquo;ve had to buy an extra 15GB on top of all that just to get me over the line. This brings the cost up to roughly €60.\nOne interesting thing to note was that the MR3220 had some trouble dealing with the Huawei E5377 switching between 3G and 4G signals depending on the network quality on a particular day. This caused the MR3220 to lose its connection entirely with the E5377 entirely and required a restart. This problem was resolved by configuring the E5377 to only use the 3G network so no switching occurred thereby stopping the MR3220 from getting confused.\nIn addition, the 4G signal in the area seems to have strengthened and I\u0026rsquo;m now getting on average 25Mb download speeds. Happy days.\nUpdate #2\r#\rAndrew L got in touch to say that an external antenna he purchased for use with his E5377 made a huge difference to the signal reception. Prior to using the antenna he was barely getting a 3G signal indoors and could only get 4G when the dongle was held out an upstairs window. His speeds went from approximately 1Mb to almost 40Mb.\nAlso worth noting is that Andrew uses a Netgear N900 (WNCE4004) 4-Port Wi-Fi adapter to connect to his Meteor broadband router wirelessly instead of via USB. I think this is a better solution than the TP-LINK MR3220 as it bypasses any compatibility issues you might get connecting a mobile broadband dongle to a router via a USB cable.\n","date":"25 February 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/rural-broadband-woes/","section":"Posts","summary":"Until recently, Eircom’s fixed-line ADSL service was just about adequate for my broadband needs.

Mapping networked drives on Mac or Windows is pretty straightforward using the Mac Finder and Window\u0026rsquo;s explorer GUIs and both give you an option to automatically reconnect on startup. On Linux however, a little more work is involved to automatically map network locations, so this article will describe how to map network drives on a machine running the Ubuntu flavour of Linux.\nMapping network drives on Linux is called mounting. For example, if you have all your photos on a networked drive you\u0026rsquo;ll need to mount this directory onto your Linux desktop in order to access it. In Ubuntu, network mounts are temporary by default. This means that the next time you restart Ubuntu it will not remember to remount the network drive from the last time you did it. This can be annoying when you want to permanently mount a network drive you will be using a lot. To mount a network drive permanently you will have to add a line to your file /etc/fstab. This file tells Linux what drives you want mounted on boot up. You need to add a line similar to the existing ones, depending on your exact setup.\nIn my case, I keep all my photos centrally on a ReadyNAS file server that sits and runs in a closet under my stairs. I also have a collection of Windows, Mac and Linux laptops/desktops in the house. When anyone wants to look at the photos they just need to connect to the server and navigate to the /photos directory. Since ReadyNAS servers come with built-in support for numerous file protocols all of these systems can access the photos on the ReadyNAS drive using the most suitable protocol.\nReadyNAS NV+\rSo what file protocols exactly? Looking at the ReadyNAS configuration panel you\u0026rsquo;ll see that it includes support for CIFS, NFS and AFP. CIFS stands for Common Internet File System and was largely developed by Microsoft for Windows operating systems (it\u0026rsquo;s in fact based on a protocol called Server Message Block and therefore CIF is sometimes referred to as SMB). NFS is the Network File System for Unix and Linux operating systems. Finally, AFP is the Apple File Protocol and is used by machines running a Mac OS.\nReadyNAS Admin Console\rLinux machines have in fact two choices: connect to the ReadyNAS using CIFS or NFS. So what\u0026rsquo;s the difference? It boils down to security. CIFS is generally the better choice when working within an open network. NFS can be less complicated but is only really suitable within a secure network due to its lack of security. I\u0026rsquo;m chosing to take the CIFS route so let\u0026rsquo;s see how that\u0026rsquo;s done.\nAllowing a Linux system to access a Windows CIFS file system is done using Samba. Samba is a free software re-implementation of the CIFS networking protocol designed to enable Windows operating systems and non-Microsoft operating systems to connect. Samba is now standard on nearly all distributions of Linux. Connecting to a CIF file system from Linux is therefore simply a matter of using Samba\u0026rsquo;s client application which is called smbclient (you only need to install the Samba server if you wish to allow Windows machines to access a Linux file system).\nStart by installing the necessary Samba utilities:\n1.. Install smbfs and smbclient(the Samba File System \u0026amp; Samba client) on your machine using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install smbfs smbclient\r2.. Once installed you can check what directories are shared on your network drive using the the command smbclient -L [server] (replace [server] with the IP address or DNS name of your CIFS server). In this example the IP address of my ReadyNAS server is 192.168.1.14 so the command is:\nsmbclient -L 192.168.1.14\rThis should display a list of all the currently shared directories on the file server. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\nDomain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.34] Sharename Type Comment --------- ---- ------- IPC$ IPC IPC Service (ReadyNAS) video Disk Videos shared Disk Public directory for everyone\u0026#39;s use photos Disk Family photos music Disk Everyone\u0026#39;s Music media Disk Media downloads Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.34] Server Comment --------- ------- READYNAS ReadyNAS Workgroup Master --------- ------- WORKGROUP READYNAS\rTo mount the photos directory on my machine I\u0026rsquo;ll begin by first creating a local folder that will act as the mount point. Here\u0026rsquo;s the command that will create a mount directory in /home/dermot/Desktop/photos:\nmkdir /home/dermot/Desktop/photos\rThe next step is to test that the mount will actually work using the following command:\nsudo smbmount //192.168.1.14/photos /home/dermot/Desktop/photos -o username=admin,password=secretword,uid=1000,mask=000\rIf this works you should see a /photodirectory mounted on the Desktop. Unmount it again using the following command:\nsudo smbumount /home/dermot/photos Getting drives to mount automatically\r#\rSo now that we\u0026rsquo;ve established that the mount works, we can move on to configure Linux to mount this drive automatically each time it starts. This is done by adding the above command to a file called /etc/fstab.\n1.. Open the /etc/fstabfile for editing:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\r2.. Add the following line to the end of the fstab file:\n//192.168.1.14/photos /home/dermot/photos smbfs auto,credentials= /home/dermot/.smbpasswd,uid=1000,unmask=000,user 0 0\r3.. Run the remount command:\nsudo mount -a\r4.. Navigate to the /home/dohalloran/Desktop/photos mount directory.\n5.. For more information mounting drives in Ubuntu see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently\nHandling password protected directories\r#\rIf your network drive is password protected then you\u0026rsquo;ll need to include your username and password details in the mount command. There\u0026rsquo;s a way of doing this that\u0026rsquo;s secure.\n1.. When mounting a password protected directory the login details are specified as follows:\nsudo smbmount //192.168.1.14/photos /home/dermot/Desktop/photos -o username=admin,password=secretword,uid=1000,mask=000\r2.. However, because the fstab file is located in the /etc directory it means it\u0026rsquo;s visible and accessible to everyone. This is not a good idea as your username and password will be visible to everyone. So a way around this is to store the username and password in a separate, secure file and simply reference it from the fstab file. So let\u0026rsquo;s create that file first. Do it in the /rootdirectory as follows:\nsudo gedit /root/.credentials\r3.. Add the username and password to the newly created file so they appear as follows:\nusername=your_smb_username password=your_smb_password\r4.. After exiting and saving the file, make it read-only so no one else can access it and see your credentials. This is done using the chmodcommand as follows:\nsudo chmod 600 /root/.credentials\r5.. Next, open the /etc/fstabfile for editing:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\r6.. Update the line in your fstab file as follows:\n//192.168.1.14/photos /home/dermot/photos smbfs auto,credentials= /home/dermot/.smbpasswd,uid=1000,unmask=000,user 0 0\r7.. Remount to test things by run the remount command:\nsudo mount -a\r","date":"29 July 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mounting-network-locations-on-linux-using-samba/","section":"Posts","summary":"A convenient way to browse files on a networked drive is to map its location to your operating system so that it automatically connects to the drive each time it starts up.

It\u0026rsquo;s a superb solution. It consists of a small black box known as a Receiver. This connects to your wireless or LAN network and streams music from any device on it running the Squeezecenter Server software and plays it through your own speaker setup. It\u0026rsquo;s all managed using a separate Controller that wirelessly connects to the headless receiver and enables you to browse your music collection and decide what gets played.\nUnfortunately, one day the controller just stopped working. Without the controller it became impossible to configure the Receiver. A new controller cost anything up to 300 euro and just wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the expense. Luckily, after some investigating, I found a pretty good solution - a Robin Bowes had written an application called Net:UDAP that could connect to a Squeezebox Receiver and enable you to setup and configure the receiver\u0026rsquo;s wireless settings so it can connect to your network.\nSqueezebox Duet with controller\rThe application comes in the form of a Perl script which when run, connects to the receiver over a direct ethernet connection and enables you to manually set the receiver\u0026rsquo;s settings just like you would have done with a working controller. Once configured you can then use the free Squeezebox app available from the Android market or Apple Store on your phone or tablet to control the Receiver just like you would with the original controller.\nSummary of the Steps\r#\rThe following is a short summary of the steps. More detailed instructions are found further down.\n1.. Start by performing a factory reset the Squeezebox Receiver. Do this by holding down the button for five seconds or more until it starts flashing red.\n2.. Connect the Receiver directly to your PC or laptop using an ethernet cable.\n3.. Determine the IP address of the Receiver. Use ipconfig /all in Windows or ifconfig -a in Unix.\n4.. Install Perl on your operating system.\n5.. Download a ZIP of the Net::UDAP application from https://github.com/robinbowes/net-udap and extract it somewhere on your computer (or clone the project if you\u0026rsquo;ve got Git installed).\n6.. Run the Net::UDAP application\u0026rsquo;s udap_shell.pl script as follows to connect to the Squeezebox Receiver:\nudap_shell.pl --local-address [Squeezebox Receiver IP address]\r7.. Run the scripts commands in its CLI to configure the receiver\u0026rsquo;s wireless network settings and the address of the Squeezebox server running on your network.\nPrepare the Squeezebox Receiver and get its IP Address\r#\r1.. Before starting, the Squeezebox Receiver must be in init mode indicated by its front button flashing slowly red. Do this by performing a factory reset on the receiver by pressing and holding the button for five seconds or more until the light starts flashing red.\nResetting the receiver\r2.. Once in init mode, connect the Squeezebox Receiver to your laptop using an ethernet cable.\n3.. Turn off your laptop\u0026rsquo;s wireless so it\u0026rsquo;s only looking at the LAN network.\n4.. Open a command window and get the IP address of the Squeezebox Receiver using the following DOS command:\nipconfig /all\rYou should get some output like the following:\nC:\\Users\\Dermot\u0026gt; ipconfig /all Windows IP Configuration Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : MyLaptop Primary Dns Suffix . . . . . . . : Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Hybrid IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No DNS Suffix Search List. . . . . . : Wireless LAN adapter Wireless Network Connection: Media State . . . . . . . . . . . : Media disconnected Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : Description . . . . . . . . . . . : Intel(R) Centrino(R) Ultimate-N 6300 AGN Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 24-77-03-26-B3-D4 DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes Autoconfiguration Enabled . . . . : Yes Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : Description . . . . . . . . . . . : Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 00-21-CC-72-45-01 DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : Yes Autoconfiguration Enabled . . . . : Yes Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::a4fb:9202:38d6:a32a%14(Preferred) Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address. . : 192.168.1.4(Preferred) Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0 Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : DHCPv6 IAID . . . . . . . . . . . : 285221324 DHCPv6 Client DUID. . . . . . . . : 00-01-00-01-16-B2-73-D0-00-21-CC-72-45-01 DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : fec0:0:0:ffff::1%1 fec0:0:0:ffff::2%1 fec0:0:0:ffff::3%1 NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled\r5.. Examine the output and look for the Ethernet adapter details. Here you should find a section Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address which will list the IP address assigned to the device connected on the ethernet port. See the highlighted line above for an example - you can see how the IP address of the Receiver is 192.168.1.4.\nInstall Perl\r#\rTo run the Net:UDAP application you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Perl installed on your environment. Perl is typically installed by default on Ubuntu. A good way to run Perl scripts in Windows is using the ActivePerl distribution.\nDownload the installer file for its free community edition from here and run it to install Perl on your Windows environment. Once installed run the command perl -version within a command window to test that it works:\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601] Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

If you have access to the Internet, point your browser at http://www.perl.org/, the Perl Home Page. C:\\Users\\Dermot\u0026gt;\rRun the Application to Connect to the Squeezebox Receiver\r#\r1.. Download a ZIP of the Net::UDAP application from https://github.com/robinbowes/net-udap and extract it somewhere on your computer (or clone the project if you\u0026rsquo;ve got Git installed).\n2.. To get the Net::UDAP application to connect to the Squeezebox Receiver you need to run its udap_shell.pl script and specify the IP address of the Receiver you determined in the previous section. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of the command where the IP address of the Receiver is 169.254.163.42:\nC:\\branches\\1.0.x\\scripts\u0026gt;udap_shell.pl --local-address 169.254.163.42\rIf the script successfully connects to the network address and you should see a command line interface as follows:\nC:\\branches\\1.0.x\\scripts\u0026gt;UDAP\u0026gt;\rIf the connection fails then it's typically because the IP address is incorrect. See the Troubleshooting section for some help.\r3.. Use the help command to see what commands are available in the CLI:\nUDAP\u0026gt; help Type \u0026#39;help command\u0026#39; for more detailed help on a command. Commands: configure - configure a device discover - Discover UDAP devices and get their current configuration exit - Exit configure mode (if configuring a device), otherwise exit application fields - Display a list of valid device fields help - prints this screen, or help on \u0026#39;command\u0026#39; list - List discovered devices, or a specific information about a device quit - Exit configure mode (if configuring a device), otherwise exit application reset - Reset a device save_data - Save data parameters to device(s) save_ip - Save ip parameters to device(s) set - Set device parameter(s)\r4.. The next step is to use the CLI to discover the Receiver and start its configuration.\nDiscover and Configure the Receiver\r#\rOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve launched the script and connected to the Receiver you can begin to configure it.\n1.. The first step is to tell the application which Squeezebox Receiver you wish to configure. Do this using the discover command to scan the IP address for Squeezebox Receivers running on the connection. You should get the following type of output:\nUDAP\u0026gt; discover info: *** Broadcasting adv_discovery message to MAC address 00:00:00:00:00:00 on 255.255.255.255 info: adv_discovery response received from 00:04:20:16:05:8f info: *** Broadcasting get_ip message to MAC address 00:04:20:16:05:8f on 255.255.255.255 info: get_ip response received from 00:04:20:16:05:8f info: *** Broadcasting get_data message to MAC address 00:04:20:16:05:8f on 255.255.255.255 info: get_data response received from 00:04:20:16:05:8f\r2.. When the scan has completed as above, use the list command to display the available Squeezebox Receivers. There should only be one in this case:\nUDAP\u0026gt; list # MAC Address Type Status == ================= ========== =============== 1 00:04:20:16:05:8f squeezebox init\r3.. Use the configure command to select the Squeezebox Receiver to configure based on its number (it will always be 1):\nUDAP\u0026gt; configure 1 UDAP [1] (squeezebox 16058f)\u0026gt;\rNotice the prompt has changed to show the device number [1] and name\n4.. You are now ready to change the Receiver\u0026rsquo;s configuration details. Use the list command to display the current settings. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of all the configuration fields and their default values:\nUDAP [1] (squeezebox 16058f)\u0026gt; list bridging: 0 hostname: interface: 0 lan_gateway: 0.0.0.0 lan_ip_mode: 1 lan_network_address: 0.0.0.0 lan_subnet_mask: 255.255.255.0 primary_dns: 0.0.0.0 secondary_dns: 0.0.0.0 server_address: 0.0.0.0 squeezecenter_address: 0.0.0.0 squeezecenter_name: wireless_SSID: wireless_channel: 0 wireless_keylen: 0 wireless_mode: 0 wireless_region_id: 0 wireless_wep_key_0: wireless_wep_key_1: wireless_wep_key_2: wireless_wep_key_3: wireless_wep_on: 0 wireless_wpa_cipher: 1 wireless_wpa_on: 0 wireless_wpa_mode: 1 wireless_wpa_psk:\rTo see a list of all the available fields and their descriptions use the fields command:\nUDAP\u0026gt; fields bridging: Use device as a wireless bridge (not sure about this) hostname: Device hostname (is this set automatically?) interface: 0 - wireless, 1 - wired lan_gateway: IP address of default network gateway, (e.g. 192.168.1.1) lan_ip_mode: 0 - Use static IP details, 1 - use DHCP to discover IP details lan_network_address: IP address of device, (e.g. 192.168.1.10) lan_subnet_mask: Subnet mask of local network, (e.g. 255.255.255.0) primary_dns: IP address of primary DNS server secondary_dns: IP address of secondary DNS server server_address: IP address of currently active server (either Squeezenetwork or local server squeezecenter_address: IP address of local Squeezecenter server squeezecenter_name: Name of local Squeezecenter server (???) wireless_SSID: Wireless network name wireless_channel: Wireless channel (used by AdHoc mode???) wireless_keylen: Length of wireless key, (0 - 64-bit, 1 - 128-bit) wireless_mode: 0 - Infrastructure, 1 - Ad Hoc wireless_region_id: 4 - US, 6 - CA, 7 - AU, 13 - FR, 14 - EU, 16 - JP, 21 - TW, 23 - CH wireless_wep_key_0: WEP Key 0 wireless_wep_key_1: WEP Key 1 wireless_wep_key_2: WEP Key 2 wireless_wep_key_3: WEP Key 3 wireless_wep_on: 0 - WEP Off, 1 - WEP On wireless_wpa_cipher: 1 - CCMP, 2 - TKIP wireless_wpa_on: 0 - WPA Off, 1 - WPA On wireless_wpa_mode: 1 - WPA, 2 - WPA2 wireless_wpa_psk: WPA Public Shared Key\rIn general you only need to configure a subset of these fields to get things working. It all depends on the type of network you want the Receiver to connect to.\nserver_address - It\u0026rsquo;s not clear from the documentation what exactly this setting relates to but if it\u0026rsquo;s not set it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. I assumed it relates to the IP address of the Squeezebox server (the same as the squeezecenter_address field). You decide what the IP value is - make sure its a unique address anywhere on your network. lan_subnet_mask - The subnet mask of your network. The default is 255.255.255.0 so if your subnet mask is the same then there\u0026rsquo;s no need to change it. squeezecenter_address - The IP address of the Squeezecenter server running on your network. wireless_SSID - The SSID of your wireless network. wireless_wep_key_0 wireless_wep interface- 0 - wireless, 1 - wired hostname - A name for the Squeezebox Receiver so you can easily identify it.

It’s a superb solution. It consists of a small black box known as a Receiver. This connects to your wireless or LAN network and streams music from any device on it running the Squeezecenter Server software and plays it through your own speaker setup. It’s all managed using a separate Controller that wirelessly connects to the headless receiver and enables you to browse your music collection and decide what gets played.\n","title":"Setting up a Squeezebox Duet Without a Controller","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 March 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/squeezebox/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Squeezebox","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 March 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/joomla/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Joomla","type":"tags"},{"content":"Code listings are often rendered badly in online articles and blogs making them difficult to read and understand. A nice utility to help format and display code within HTML is Alex Gorbatchev\u0026rsquo;s widely used SyntaxHighlighter. It is developed in JavaScript so runs in any modern browser. Numerous Joomla implementations of SyntaxHighlighter exist in the form of plugins (have a look here: http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/coding-a-scripts-integration/code-display. The one I used is called Joomler SyntaxHighlighter and was developed for Joomla 1.6 but works in Joomla 2.5 also. It enables you to display nice code listings like this:\nfunction foo() { if (counter \u0026amp; lt;= 10) return; // it works! }\rSimply install and enable the plugin in your Joomla installation and highlight any of your code snippets by including some properties within the \u0026lt;pre/\u0026gt; tag while in HTML editing mode. For example:\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026#34;brush: js; gutter: true;\u0026#34;} function foo() { if (counter \u0026amp;amp; lt;= 10) return; // it works! } \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\rThe SyntaxHighligher supports a whole bunch of brushes including JavaScript, PHP and even Bash. it also includes an auto brush facility which can automatically analyze the code listing to determine what brush to use if you don\u0026rsquo;t specify one (it defaults to plain text).\nNote that when using the preformatted style (i.e. the \u0026lt;pre/\u0026gt; tag) you will need to escape all right angle brackets must be HTML escaped (meaning all \u0026lt; must be replaced with \u0026amp;lt;).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a bash example:\nsudo ./make_me_a_sandwich.sh\rSome links:\nhttp://www.webresourcesdepot.com/11-syntax-highlighters-to-beautify-code-presentation/\n","date":"20 March 2012","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/syntax-highlighting-in-joomla/","section":"Posts","summary":"Code listings are often rendered badly in online articles and blogs making them difficult to read and understand.
