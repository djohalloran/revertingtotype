      <description>A few years ago my sister bought a Squeezebox Duet to play her music. It’s a superb solution. It consists of a small black box known as a Receiver. This connects to your wireless or LAN network and streams music from any device on it running the Squeezecenter Server software and plays it through your own speaker setup. It’s all managed using a separate Controller that wirelessly connects to the headless receiver and enables you to browse your music collection and decide what gets played.
