Consistent results when making bread is tricky. Things like measurements, room temperature and kneading time can all impact on the success of a loaf. Using a bread maker goes a long way to ensuring at least the temperature and kneading are largely consistent and takes the guesswork out of these aspects.

The following proportions work well in a standard bread maker to produce a very light and flavoursome bread. The fennel and tomoto is a classic combination. The bread smells and tastes great and also works well as toast the following day. 

The recipe is designed for the standard 1KG loaf setting which takes 3 hours in most bread makers. On starting, the machine will create the initial dough mix and knead for about 10 minutes before an initial proving of about 30 mins. It will then knead the dough a second time for another 10 minutes and leave that to prove again at which point the baking will begin. 

Another option is to use the bread maker's dough setting to prove the bread and then transfer to a tin for baking in an oven - something you might want to do for more control of browning of the bread.

* 480g strong flour
* 350ml water
* 2 teaspoons dried yeast (or 1 x 7g sachet)
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon tomato puree
* 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, crushed in a pestle and mortar to release their aroma

1. Measure out the water, puree and olive oil and combine into the bread maker's bowl.

    <substep>While most hand made bread recipes specify warm (not hot) water to help encourage the yeast reaction, this is not necessary when using a bread maker timed to run overnight. Room temperature water will produce the same results.</substep>

2. Sift the flour before adding it on top of the liquid ingredients. 

    <substep>The flour acts as a barrier between the wet and dry ingredients. This lets you delay the mixing until early next morning to have the bread ready when you wake up. For example, setting the timer on the bread maker to begin at 4:30am should produce a fresh and cooled loaf ready for eating at 8am. </substep>

    <substep>Sifting aerates the flour and removes compaction  - a factor in how a loaf turns out.</substep>

3. Add the salt, sugar and fennel seeds on top of the flour. 

4. Make a small well on top of the flour and add the yeast, making sure it remains dry.

5. Start the bread maker's white loaf program or set it to start overnight so you can have the bread ready for the morning. 

6. When finished, take out the bread and let it cool on a rack before cutting.
